Create a GitHub repository with 3 folders (one for each of the above platforms), and a brief README file with at least 2 sentences describing your repository.
Work on 2 - 3 beginner level challenges from any of the above platforms (or one from each!).
In each folder, create a file (.txt, .js, etc.) containing the problem you attempted to solve, and your solution.
NOTE: You can have a single file for each problem, or a single file for each website. It does not matter.
Once youâ€™re done, push all of your code to the GitHub repo you created.
